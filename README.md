# Eric's Blog Generator

This is my very un-creatively named static site generator that's geared towards
generating my blog.

It's roughly octopress / jekyll compatible (or inspired might be a better way to put it), at least to start with, because I
want to be able to do a mostly in-place upgrade. Once I switch over to my own
generator though, I will probably let things diverge a bit more.
