This is my very un-creatively named static site generator with an emphasis on blogging.
EBG is primarily meant to power <https://theincredibleholk.org>.
You're welcome to use it for your own site if you want, but at this point that's likely to be fairly labor-intensive.
For example, EBG does not yet include any pre-defined themes so you would have to make one from scratch and the theme-making process is poorly documented.

EBG is inspired by [Octopress] and [Jekyll], and perhaps even largely compatible because I developed EBG to do an in-place upgrade from my Octopress-powered blog.
Over time it has begun to diverge somewhat in order to support my own desires, and will likely continue to diverge in the future.
